# 6 - Weather Dashboard

In this project I have used HTML as the baseline layout, styled it with CSS and dynamically created elements through JaveScript And Jquery for the AJAX function for information to be extracted from the API and made it user interactive to record the location search in the local storage for the user to view their recent searches. The weather information is fetched from a weather API and displayed on the screen for the current weather and the next 5 days.

Below is the screenshot of the webpage and The live link to the website: https://github.com/zaydsaid1/web-apis
